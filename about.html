                        <p>
                            Once upon a time, in a world driven by technology, a group of talented <br> designers came together
                            with a shared vision. They believed that design <br> could shape the way people interacted
                            with digital products. With their <br> passion for aesthetics and usability, they founded
                            SquareUp Digital <br> Product Agency's design department. Their mission was to create
                            visually <br> stunning and user-friendly interfaces that would leave a lasting <br> impression.

                        <p>
                            Meanwhile, a team of brilliant engineers was busy crafting the backbone <br> of digital
                            innovation. With their expertise in coding and development, they <br> founded the engineering
                            division of SquareUp. They believed that <br> technology had the power to transform ideas into
                            reality. Their mission <br> was to build robust, scalable, and cutting-edge digital solutions
                            that <br> would push the boundaries of what was possible.

                            In the midst of the creative and technical minds, a group of project <br> managers emerged as
                            the glue that held everything together. They <br> understood the importance of effective
                            communication, organization, and <br> efficient execution. With their skills in planning and
                            coordination, they <br> founded SquareUp's project management team. Their mission was to<br>ensure
                            that every project ran smoothly, on time, and within budget.
